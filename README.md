# JsonComparer
English | [简体中文](README-CN.md)  
 Compare your request to see if the return body is as expected by passing in the sample and return body strings.  
 You can ignore value comparisons for certain fields, but you still need to make sure that the field is in the return body.  
 When there are extra fields, they are not considered as expected.
